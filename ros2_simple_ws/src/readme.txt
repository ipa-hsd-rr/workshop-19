CMakelists.txt is auto generated by the "ros2 pkg create" but for python files we need the "setup.py" which needs to be created manually.
refer here'https://github.com/ros2/tutorials/blob/master/rclpy_tutorials/setup.py'

setup.py was created and the modifications are commented inside the script.

To build any packages
	- source  ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
	- colcon build  --symlink-install
	- source install/setup.bash

To run a node
	- ros2 run ros2_talker talker
	- ros2 run ros2_listener listener
